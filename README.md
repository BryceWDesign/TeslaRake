# TeslaRake: Ambient Energy Harvester

**TeslaRake** is an open-source, multi-source ambient energy harvesting device designed to operate entirely off-grid. Built to be portable, rugged, and scalable, it draws real-world usable power from a combination of **RF, thermal, vibrational, electrostatic, and light** energy sources — simultaneously.

## Core Objective

Harvest *all available ambient energy* from the environment and store enough usable electricity to **charge a standard smartphone at least 8 times daily**. The system uses verified hardware components and configurations. No theory — only reproducible, real-world engineering.

## Core Capabilities

- **Multi-source collection**: RF, Piezo (vibration), Thermoelectric, Triboelectric, Low-light solar
- **Continuous energy capture**: 24/7 low-draw harvesting with onboard storage
- **Integrated storage module**: High-capacity Li-Ion + ultracap hybrid system
- **Smart output**: 5V USB delivery (1–2A burst), optional regulated DC output
- **Size constraint**: Portable, no larger than two microwave ovens side-by-side

## Project Structure

- `/docs/` – System design, theory of operation, calculations
- `/hardware/` – Schematics, BOM, wiring diagrams
- `/cad/` – 3D models for enclosure, vibration harvester supports
- `/firmware/` – Smart power management controller (optional, microcontroller-based)
- `/images/` – Photos and reference graphics
- `/tests/` – Logged energy collection performance and test configurations

## Status

**Phase 1 Active**: Mapping all viable real-world energy sources + component sourcing
