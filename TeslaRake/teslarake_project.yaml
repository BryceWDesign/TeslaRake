- **C1** = Matching capacitor tuned to frequency band (e.g. 2.4GHz Wi-Fi, FM, etc.)
- **D1** = Schottky diode (fast, low Vf)
- **C2** = Bypass ceramic for ripple suppression

---

### Layout Tips

- Use **separate parallel antennas**, each tuned to different bands:
  - Antenna 1: 2.4GHz Wi-Fi (PCB trace)
  - Antenna 2: 800–900MHz (cellular)
  - Antenna 3: FM band (wire whip or telescoping)
- PCB layout must minimize path length between diode and capacitor
- **Shielded enclosures degrade RF collection** — antennas must be exposed or external

## Output Characteristics

- Voltage range: 50mV–500mV (depends on environment)
- Current: ~µA range, ideal for trickle
- Requires boost converter (e.g. LTC3108, MAX756) for usable 3.3V–5V

---

## Real-World Test Reference

- Verified ambient RF collection in urban indoor environment:
  - ~160 µW at 2.4GHz with tuned dipole and HSMS-2852
  - ~300 µW across FM band near window with ~1m whip
